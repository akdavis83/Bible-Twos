  </p><p>
    (Galatians 4:24) Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
  </p><p>

  </p><p>
    <b>(2 Corinthians 13:1) This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. </b> (1 Corinthians 14:29) Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
  </p><p>
(1 Corinthians 14:27) If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.  </p><p>
      
  </p><p>
 (1 Corinthians 6:16) What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. </p><p>
    
  </p><p>
     (Acts 28:30) And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
 </p><p>
    (Acts 1:10) And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
  </p><p>      
    (John 19:18) Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
  </p><p>
